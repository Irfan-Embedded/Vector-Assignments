/*
 * Pridiction :
 * ----------
 *	In C programming, it is generally true that recursion can be slower than loops in most cases. 
 *	Recursion involves the function calling itself repeatedly until a base case is reached, 
 *	which can lead to additional overhead in terms of function calls and stack management.
